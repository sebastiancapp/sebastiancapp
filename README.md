Hi 👋 My name is Sebastian Capp
Data Scientist and Program Manager

As a dedicated data scientist, innate explorer, and lifelong learner, my journey revolves around harnessing data to uncover insights that empower others and contribute towards a more equitable world.

My passion for using technology for social good was shaped and honed during my time at the University of Michigan, where I earned a Master of Applied Data Science degree in 2023. I firmly believe the intentional and ethical collaboration between software development, data science, and social work can foster a new wave of positive societal change.
