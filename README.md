As a dedicated data scientist, innate explorer, and lifelong learner, my journey involves harnessing data to uncover insights in hopes of empowering others and contributing to a more equitable world.

My passion for using technology for social good was shaped and honed at the University of Michigan, where I earned my Master of Applied Data Science degree. I firmly believe the intentional and ethical collaboration between software development, data science, and social work can continue to foster positive change.
